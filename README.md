# Pistol-Training-System

A simple MVP prototype for a training system using windows forms to communicate with other units through a hub unit over radio. Each run has parameters that can be changed and given more or less "unpredictability"(randomness) including:
- amount of bystanders
- amount of targets
- amount of lives per target
- frequency of bluff apearances
